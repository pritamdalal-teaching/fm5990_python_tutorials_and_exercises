    "The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce you to the Jupyter Notebook.  This file you are looking at right now is a Jupyter notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook format conveniently allows you to combine words/sentences, computer code, and mathematical notation.  Some people spend a lot of time to creating beautiful and well organized notebooks books that are used for communicating analysis (e.g. *Python Data Science Handbook* is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks).  However, a vast majority of notebooks are used as a convenient interative programming environment.\n",

    "For those of you familiar with R, a Jupyter Notebook is similar in functionality to R markdown notebooks.  In fact, there are lots of notebooks out there now: Matlab, Google, etc.\n",

    "Even though it opens up in your browser, it is not on the internet, it lives on your computer.  Your web browser is simply being used as a piece of software to view and interact with the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "At it's heart, a notebook is a series of *cells*.  There are two kinds of cells: 1) code cells that contain (usually) python code; 2) markdown cells which contain markdown or latex."
